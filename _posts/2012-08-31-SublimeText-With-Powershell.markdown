Ny new Favorite cross platform text editor is [Sublime Text 2][1]. It works on Windows, Mac OS and Linux, and i am very happy with it. My only problem is the path to start it is not exactly easy to type... So, with the help of PowerShell, my new favorite command line tool on Windows, i added an alias:

* Set-Alias subl 'c:\program files\sublime text 2\sublime_text.exe'

I added this to my Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 file in Documents\WindowsPowerShell folder. If you dont have one of these files, check out this [Computer Performance.Co.UK post on Creating PowerShell profile files][2] and then edit the file and add the line above... Now, i can edit files in Powershell with Sublime Text 2 by typing:
* subl filename

Happy days!
